==> Representational State Transfer

REST API is a URL based API diffrent form  tradational web where we sent HTML pages as a response.
In RESTFUL apis w sent data through the diffrent URL, we create our diffrent URL like 
    ->hppps://localhost/products
    ->hppps://localhost/persons
    ->hppps://localhost/animals

In such URLs we put out data. and we route though the URLs to get data on any decive like mobile,
web desktop applications.

==> WHY A RESTFUL API the tradational applications

1->In mobile applications development and other we don't need HTML pages to we need Data though which we can 
    use in our applications.
2->Where we are more intrested in data then UI or HTML pages. like google Map where we just  send the qurdinates
    to server and we get geo locations and other attributes.
3->Single page applications (SPA), where we just have a single page and we rander attiibutes over it again and
    again. We just need HTML for first rander then we only communicate with data.
